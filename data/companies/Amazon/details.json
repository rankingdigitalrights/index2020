Amazon offered scant evidence that it assesses the human rights impacts of some of its most popular services, and it published less information about how its practices affect users&#x2019; privacy and freedom of expression and information than any other digital platform we evaluate. In 2019 and 2020, investigations by researchers and journalists shed light on the company&#x2019;s failures to protect users from these and other human rights harms. Amazon&#x2019;s e-commerce platform made headlines when it <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-removes-proud-boys-trump-quote-merchandise-2020-10\">removed listings</a> for products promoting the far-right Proud Boys group, and when it <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/banned-bounty/2020/09/17/amazon-sales-peptides-doping-drugs\">banned the sale of injectable drugs</a> to protect users&#x2019; health. We found that the company failed to disclose any data around its enforcement of these content rules. When companies publish this data, it allows civil society to hold them accountable for enforcing their own rules&#x2014;an area where Amazon falls short.</p>","changes":"<ul>\n  <li>Amazon earned the second-lowest score in the governance category, after Tencent. </li>\n  <li>Amazon earned the second lowest score among digital platforms in the freedom of expression and information category for having unclear (and in some cases, nonexistent) policies on how it governs content, including buyer reviews and listings of products sold on the platform.</li>\n  <li>Amazon disclosed very little about how it handles user information, and nothing about its data retention policies (P6), despite its deep reliance on user data to fuel its business model.</li>\n</ul>","keyRecommendation":"<ul>\n  <li>Establish strong corporate governance and oversight over human rights.

The language used suggests that Amazon is primarily focused on human rights risks in its supply chain, but not other types of human rights risks (G1). </li>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Stakeholder engagement: </span>On its Sustainability Partnerships page, Amazon lists a number of external partners with which it engages, but none of these partnerships address freedom of expression and information, privacy, or potential human rights harms such as discrimination (G5).</li>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Human rights due diligence: </span>Amazon provided no evidence that it conducts any type of human rights impact or risk assessments (G4a-e). </li>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Remedy: </span>We found no evidence of a remedy mechanism for freedom of expression and information or privacy related grievances (G6a). The company disclosed the steps sellers need to follow to appeal the deactivation of their accounts and the removal of their listings (G6b). The company did not disclose options for buyers to appeal the deactivation of their accounts and removal of their comments<span class=\"font-bold\">. </span>Overall, Amazon provided no evidence of a robust and predictable appeals process, which should include oversight by a human reviewer, a clear reviewing time frame, and an opportunity to present additional information.</li>\n</ul>","freedom":"<p>Amazon disclosed little about its policies and practices affecting freedom of expression and information, revealing less than all other digital platforms we reviewed, except for Baidu. It was the least transparent about platform rules and enforcement. </p><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Content moderation: </span>Content and account rules for Amazon.com and Amazon Drive were easy to find and understand, but Alexa&#x2019;s rules were less accessible. The company failed to provide any proof that it enforces these rules (F4a, F4b). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Algorithmic use and content curation: </span>Amazon did not publish a policy outlining how it uses algorithms on its services (F1d), or about if and how it uses algorithms to curate the content that users can access on either Amazon.com or Alexa (F12<span class=\"font-bold\">)</span>. </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Advertising content and targeting: </span>Ad content policies and targeting rules were easy to find for Amazon.com. Ad content rules for Alexa were only accessible through Amazon&#x2019;s developer page, and were therefore harder to find (F3b,c). The company published no data about the enforcement of its ad content or targeting policies (F4c).</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Censorship demands</span>: Amazon was one of two digital platforms&#x2014;along with Samsung&#x2014;that failed to reveal any information about its processes for responding to government and private demands for content and account restrictions (F5a, F5b). Nor did it disclose data on the number and volume of such requests it received and complied with (F6, F7). </li>\n</ul>","privacy":"<p>Amazon earned the second-lowest privacy score among digital platforms, outperforming only Samsung. It disclosed very little about its handling of user information, and less than all other platforms about policies for keeping user data secure. </p><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Handling of user data: </span>The Amazon Privacy Notice, which applies to all of the services we evaluated, was easy to find. Out of 14 digital platforms, however, Amazon was the least transparent about how it handles user information (P3-P9), leaving users in the dark about whether and how the company uses their information to develop algorithms (P1b). It shared nothing about its data retention policies (P6) and did not allow users to obtain a copy of their user information (P8). Amazon offered very limited options for users to exercise their rights over their own data. In the Amazon Advertising Preferences, users can opt out of interest-based ads. Even after selecting that option, though, users may still see personalized ads, according to the policy (P7). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Government and private demands for user data: </span>Amazon revealed some information about how it handles government demands for user data. In its Information Requests Transparency Report, Amazon disclosed how it responds to National Security Letter requests, but it did not provide any information about how or whether it responds to other types of non-judicial requests, such as emergency requests from law enforcement, since it is prohibited by <a href=\"http://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2048\">law</a> from doing so. Like many other companies we rank, Amazon did not provide any information about how it handles private demands for user information (P10b) or the volume of such requests (P11b). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Security: </span>Amazon disclosed less than all other digital platforms about its policies and practices for keeping user data secure. It offered no information about protocols limiting employee access to user data (P13) and no information about its policies for responding to data breaches (P15). Amazon was one of the least transparent digital platforms about its encryption policies (P16).</li>\n</ul>","footnotes":"footnotes missing"}
