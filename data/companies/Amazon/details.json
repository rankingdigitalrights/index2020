The company published less information about how its practices affect users&#x2019; freedom of expression and privacy than any other digital platform we evaluate.</span><span class=\"font-bold\"></span>In 2019 and 2020, multiple investigations by researchers and journalists shed light on the company&#x2019;s failures to protect users from these and other human rights harms, such as discrimination. In June 2020, <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/we-are-implementing-a-one-year-moratorium-on-police-use-of-rekognition\">Amazon pledged</a>to stop selling facial recognition technology to law enforcement agencies for one year, after it was proven to carry <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/amazon-facial-technology-study.html\">racial and gender biases</a>. Amazon&#x2019;s e-commerce platform made headlines in 2020 when it <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-removes-proud-boys-trump-quote-merchandise-2020-10\">removed listings</a>for products promoting the far-right Proud Boys group, and <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/banned-bounty/2020/09/17/amazon-sales-peptides-doping-drugs%20https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-britain-idUSKBN23706W\">banned the sale of injectable drugs</a>to protect users&#x2019; health. Yet in our research, we found that the company failed to disclose any data around its enforcement of these content rules. When companies publish this data, it allows the public and civil society to hold them accountable for enforcing their own rules&#x2014;an area in which Amazon falls short, according to <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/banned-bounty/2020/09/17/amazon-sales-peptides-doping-drugs\">investigations</a>by independent media outlets. </p>","analysis":"<ul>\n  <li>Amazon earned the second-lowest score in the governance category after Tencent. </li>\n  <li>The company also earned the second-lowest score among digital platforms in the freedom of expression category for unclear or non-existent policies about how content (including buyer reviews and listings of products sold on the platform) is governed on its services.</li>\n  <li>Amazon disclosed very little about how it handles user information &#x2014;and nothing about its data retention policies (P6), despite its deep reliance on user data to fuel its business model.</li>\n</ul>","keyRecommendation":"<ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Improve disclosure of human rights due diligence: </span>Amazon should disclose more information about its human rights due diligence, including whether it conducts human rights impact assessments in association with the use and development of algorithms.</li>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Increase transparency about platform rules enforcement: </span>Amazon should regularly publish data about the volume and nature of actions it takes to restrict content that violates the company&#x2019;s rules.</li>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Increase transparency about handling of user information: </span>Amazon should provide more information about how and for what purposes it collects, infers, and shares user information.

The language used in the &#x201C;Principles&#x201D; document suggests that Amazon is primarily focused on human rights risks in its supply chain, but not other types of human rights risks (G1). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Stakeholder engagement: </span>On its <a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/governance/sustainability-partnerships\">Sustainability Partnerships page</a>, Amazon lists a number of external partners with which it engages, but none of these partnerships address freedom of expression and information, privacy, or potential human rights harms such as discrimination (G5).</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Human rights due diligence: </span>Amazon provided no evidence that it conducts any type of human rights impact or risk assessments (G4a-e). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Remedy: </span>We found no published evidence that the company maintains a human rights grievance mechanism (G6a).

The company did not disclose options for buyers to appeal the deactivation of their accounts and removal of their comments<span class=\"font-bold\">. </span>Over all, Amazon provided no evidence of a robust and predictable appeals process, which should include oversight by a human reviewer, a clear reviewing timeframe, and an opportunity to present additional information. </li>\n</ul>","freedom":"<p><br>Amazon disclosed little about its policies and practices affecting freedom of expression, . It revealing ed less than all other most of the digital platforms evaluated except for , outperforming only Baidu.

However, out of 14 digital platforms, Amazon was the least transparent about how it handles user information (P3-P9), leaving users in the dark about whether and how the company uses their data to develop algorithms (P1b). Amazon offered very limited options for users to exercise their rights over their own data. In the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/adprefs\">Amazon Advertising Preferences</a>,&quot; the company provided users with the option to opt out of interest-based ads. However, even after selecting that option, users may still see personalized ads, according to the policy (P7).
