{"id":"F01c","name":"F1c","category":"freedom","label":"Access to advertising targeting policies","description":"The company should offer advertising targeting policies that are easy to find and easy to understand.","guidance":"In addition to providing accessible ad content policies (Indicator F1b), companies should also clearly disclose their ad targeting policies. The ability for advertisers or other third parties to target users with tailored content—based on their browsing behaviors, location information, and other data and characteristics that have been inferred about them—can significantly shape (or in some cases, distort) a user's online ecosystem. Targeting, which can include both paid and unpaid content, can amplify offline social inequities and can be overtly discriminatory. It can also result in so-called “filter bubbles” as well as amplify problematic content, including content intended to mislead or to spread falsehoods. Therefore, companies that enable advertisers and other third parties to target their users with tailored ads or content should publish targeting policies that users can easily find and understand, and that are available in the main languages of the company's home market. Users should be able to access and understand these rules in order to make informed decisions using the information about the ad content they are receiving. For mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant ecosystems, companies should disclose a requirement for apps or skills made available through their app stores or skill stores to provide users with an accessible advertising targeting policy.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
