{"id":"P09","name":"P9","category":"privacy","label":"Collection of user information from third parties","description":"The company should clearly disclose its practices with regard to user information it collects from third-party websites or apps through technical means, as well as user information it collects through non-technical means.","guidance":"We expect companies to disclose what information about users they collect from third parties, which can mean information collected from third-party websites or apps through technical means—for instance through cookies, plug-ins, or widgets, or through non-technical means, for instance through contractual agreements. Companies can also acquire user information through non-technical means, including as part of a contractual agreement, and this acquired data can become part of a “digital dossier” that companies may hold on their users, which can then form the basis for inferred and shared user information. Companies should be transparent and accountable about these practices so that users can understand if and how their activities are being tracked by companies even when they are not on a host company's website or when the individual is not a user of a particular service or platform.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
