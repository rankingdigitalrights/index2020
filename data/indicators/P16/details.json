The U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression has stated unequivocally that encryption and anonymity are essential for the exercise and protection of human rights. We expect companies to clearly disclose that user communications are encrypted by default, that transmissions are protected by “perfect forward secrecy,” that users have an option to turn on end-to-end encryption, and whether it is enabled by default. For mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant ecosystems, we expect companies to clearly disclose that they enable full-disk encryption.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
