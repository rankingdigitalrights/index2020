Companies also often share this information with third parties, including advertisers, governments, and legal authorities. We expect companies to clearly disclose what user information (as RDR defines it)they share and with whom. Companies should specify if they share user information with governments and with commercial entities. For mobile ecosystems, we expect the company to clearly disclose whether the privacy policies of the apps that are available in its app store specify what user information the apps share with third parties. Companies that operate personal digital assistant (PDA) ecosystems should require that third-party skills that they make available in their skill store to clearly disclose what types of user information is shared, and the types of third parties with whom they share it.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
