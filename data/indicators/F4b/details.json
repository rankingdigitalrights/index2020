This indicator expects companies to publicly disclose data about the actions they take to enforce these rules. Publishing this data is an essential first step to holding companies accountable for enforcing their own rules and for the actions they take to moderate content on their platforms and services. Companies should publish data about the number of accounts they restrict as a result of terms of service violations. They should also break out this data by violation and by the method—such as a community flagger program or automation—through which the rules violation was detected. Companies should also publish this data at least four times a year, in line with the Santa Clara Principles, and in a structured data file.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
