{"id":"G02","name":"G2","category":"governance","label":"Governance and management oversight","description":"The company's senior leadership should exercise oversight over how its policies and practices affect freedom of expression and information, and privacy.","guidance":"This indicator seeks evidence that the company has strong governance and oversight over freedom of expression and information and privacy issues at all levels of its operations. Companies should clearly disclose that senior leadership—from the board to management level—oversees and is accountable for its policies and practices affecting these human rights. To receive full credit for this indicator, companies need to clearly disclose that at each governance level (board, executive, managerial), there is clear oversight of both freedom of expression and information, and privacy issues. At the board level, this oversight could include a board of directors or another public explanation of how the board exercises oversight over these issues. Below board level, it can include a company unit, program, or individual that reports to the executive or managerial level. The committee, program, team, officer, etc. should specifically identify freedom of expression and privacy in its description of responsibilities.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
