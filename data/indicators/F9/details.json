We expect these companies to publicly commit to avoid prioritization or degradation of content. In some cases, a company may engage in legitimate traffic shaping practices in order to ensure the flow of traffic through their networks. We expect the company to publicly disclose this and to explain their purpose for doing so. Companies may engage in paid prioritization or zero rating practices, which would not fall under legitimate network management practices. A company may have a statement on its website committing to net neutrality, for example, but also offer zero rating.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
