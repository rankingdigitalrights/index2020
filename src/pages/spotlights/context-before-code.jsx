      The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a multitude of crises that stretch

      </a>
      : those with reliable internet access have been able to keep up with
      schooling, and those without have fallen behind. In the tech sector, while
      profits have soared, the spread of algorithmically-driven{" "}

        disinformation about the virus
      </a>{" "}
      has brought fatal consequences to people around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The companies we rank were caught off guard by COVID-19, yet they all have
      weathered crises before. Telcos have raced to repair infrastructure in the
      wake of natural disasters. Digital platforms have grappled with government
      censorship orders in the face of political upheaval.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The way a company responds to a crisis does not just affect its bottom
      line. It can have profound implications for the fundamental rights of
      millions, if not billions, of people, whether or not they are
      &ldquo;users&rdquo; of a product or service that the company provides.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The year 2020 could not have given us a better set of case studies in just
      how dangerous it is for these companies to be so unprepared for crisis.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Our perpetual state of emergency has exposed the holes in corporate
      policies and practices that can amplify conspiracies, deprive silenced
      voices of remedy, and further exclude the marginalized.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And yet tech juggernauts are expanding their monopolies as custodians of
      user data and gatekeepers of access to content with no more accountability
      than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In moments of crisis, companies can enable human rights violations, or
      they can try to mitigate them by following cornerstone business and human
      rights practices, like providing remedy to the affected and finding real
      ways to prevent further abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can companies shape their policies and practices so that they are
      prepared&mdash;rather than blindsided&mdash;when the next crisis strikes?
      We looked at a few key examples from the past year to help answer this
      question.

      When social media posts inciting political violence go viral, the
      consequences can be fatal. There will always be bad actors on the

      Companies cannot build resilience to shocks without bridging these gaps,

      enter new markets, to mitigate harms before they happen.

      When it comes to content moderation, companies will always make mistakes.
      Given the scale at which digital platforms operate, there is simply no way
      to protect everyone from the harms that can arise from online content and
      companies&rsquo; censorship decisions. This is why a user&rsquo;s right to
      remedy, or to appeal a company&rsquo;s content decisions, is so important.

      When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, Facebook sent home workers who review
      millions of posts each day for rule violations. The company decided to put
      its algorithms in charge instead, hoping the technology would keep content
      moderation processes moving. But the solution had at least one critical
      flaw: it was unable to address appeals. In an August 2020 press call,
      Facebook explained that it had{" "}

    <h2>How can companies prepare for crisis?</h2>
    <p>
      No person or company can anticipate every harm that will arise in an
      emergency. But there is a significant distance between this zone of
      impossibility and the lack of preparedness that many companies exhibited
      in 2020. Our indicators, which draw extensively from international human
      rights doctrine and the expertise of human rights advocates around the
      world, offer a path forward.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether circumstances are ordinary or extraordinary, companies should
      pursue three objectives (among many others) if they seek to improve.
    </p>
    <h3>1. Publicly commit to human rights</h3>
    <p>
      Companies must make a public commitment to respect human rights standards
      across their operations.
      <sup data-footnote="See Lucy Amis and Ashleigh Owens, A Guide for Business: How to Develop a Human Rights Policy, 2nd ed.

      Of course, a policy alone will not improve performance. As our 2020 data
      showed, many companies in the RDR Index committed to human rights in
      principle, but failed to demonstrate these commitments through the
      practices that actually affect users&rsquo; rights. These kinds of
      commitments can serve as a tool for a company to measure and document
      violations, and for advocates to push for better policies at the product
      and service level.

      that the company published after years of{" "}

        sustained pressure by RDR
      </a>{" "}
      and others. When Apple delayed the rollout of pro-privacy, anti-tracking

    <h3>2. Double down on due diligence</h3>
    <p>
      <span className="pull-quote">
        Large multinational companies like the ones in our index can no longer
        plead ignorance.
      </span>{" "}
      They must reinforce their policy commitments by putting human rights at
      the center of their practices, and carrying out robust human rights due
      diligence.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Companies that conduct human rights impact assessments should see early
      warning signs when political or social conflict is on the horizon, and
      they can act on this by enhancing scrutiny of online activity, stanching
      the spread of inciting or hateful content, or even notifying authorities,
      where appropriate. When chaos erupts, a company with strong due diligence
      processes in place can quickly identify how its platform may be used to
      cause harm and activate protocols to protect potential victims.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Pull back the curtain and report data</h3>
    <p>
      Companies can and do report some data on their enforcement of their own
      policies, along with compliance with government censorship and
      surveillance demands, in the form of transparency reports.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      While 16 companies in the RDR Index offer some kind of transparency report
      (and two others have begun doing so since our research cutoff date), none
      of these companies does nearly enough to show users, civil society, or
      policymakers what&rsquo;s really happening behind the curtain.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <FigureImg
      img={ImgChartF4}
      extraClass="contained"
      caption="What information do companies&rsquo; transparency reports include?"
      alt="TODO - What information do companies&rsquo; transparency reports include?"
    />
    <p>
      Only five companies in the 2020 RDR Index published data about enforcement
      of their own policies and only six revealed data on government censorship
      demands. Even existing transparency reports suffer from major blind spots.
      Facebook&rsquo;s{" "}
      <a href="https://transparency.facebook.com/community-standards-enforcement">

      , for example, does not include the total volume of restricted content or
      accounts, enforcement by restriction type, or country-specific
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, such gaps can deprive users and researchers of the ability to
      map enforcement surges to specific events, especially as companies expand
      their arsenal of enforcement actions. Greater clarity here would brighten
      what remains a grim landscape.

      fail to quash online threats of violence before they lead to real-life
      harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Companies can address these harms by anchoring all of their actions in
      international human rights standards. Companies that build respect for
      human rights into their policies and products from the start will always
      be better prepared to face uncertainty than those that do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we continue to grapple with a global crisis that has kindled
      innumerable local fires, companies continue to make ad hoc decisions that
      affect millions. They are late to embrace these standards. But late is
      better than never.
